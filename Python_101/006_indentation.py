#Pyhthon doesn't use {} style of coding block
#insted it uses indentation "Meanning white spaces"
#for Example for if satement a : is placed in the end of if statement 
#and then the block following it must be indentend.
if course == "Python 101" :
    #Now we need to indent for the code work correctly
    #we use pass to indicate no code following if statement
    pass
#Another examples
